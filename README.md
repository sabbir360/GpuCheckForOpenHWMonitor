# GpuCheckForOpenHWMonitor
This will check for GPU tempereture, applicable for multiple GPU based on  http://openhardwaremonitor.org/. But it need some tweak based on config. I set a monitoring for only GPU. And fixed for radeon RX 580 in script. It can be changed accordingly. In future it will support for Parameter pass.
